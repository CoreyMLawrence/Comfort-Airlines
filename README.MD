# Airline Simulator

## Description

The Airline Simulator project aims to create a comprehensive timetable for flight scheduling and simulate two weeks' worth of flight activity. This involves developing a structured timetable with flight schedules, unique identifiers for flights and aircraft, departure and arrival times, airport details, and passenger capacity. The simulation should accurately emulate operational challenges and flight activities over the specified period.

## Implemented Features

- Graphical User Interface
- Sophisticated Scheduling Algorithms
- Adaptive, Modular Design

## User Interface

### Features

- **Sleek Modern Design:** Our interface is meticulously crafted with a sleek modern design, offering users an immersive and visually appealing experience.
- **Dynamic Weather and Customizable Flight Selections:** Experience a fully customized journey with dynamic weather integration and the ability to personalize flight selections to your preferences.
- **Gorgeous Dashboard:** The dashboard provides a stunning display of all essential flight information, allowing users to access critical data at a glance.
- **Mock Payment and Checkout:** Our interface features a simulated payment and checkout process, offering users a realistic experience of booking flights.
- **Comprehensive Timetable:** Explore a comprehensive timetable with filtering options based on starting location and destination, ensuring easy navigation through available flight options.
- **Profits Report with Playback Capabilities:** Delve into detailed profits reports with full playback capabilities. Users can initiate playback from day one and watch as profits increase throughout the entire simulation.
- **Aircraft Simulation Page:** Gain insights into the status of each of the 56 aircraft every minute during the entire two-week simulation period.

## Approach

The project utilizes Python for development, with hubs determined based on top airports. Data calculations are performed using scripts, and information is stored in CSV files. Airport modules are created, and a Paris flight module is added. The simulation employs a greedy algorithm, and an intuitive user interface is implemented.

## Tools Used Along The Way

- PyTest
- StructLog
- PyWebiew
- SQL Alchemy

## Major Decisions

**1. Python:**
- **Rationale:** Chosen for performance, library support, and ease of use.

**2. Using CSVs Instead of a Database:**
- **Rationale:** Offered flexibility, performance, and portability.

**3. Divide and Conquer:**
- **Rationale:** Implemented for efficient time management and modularity.

## Project Structure

- **Static Data:** ./data
- **Script Pipeline:** ./scripts
- **Simulation:** ./src
- **Reports:** ./reports

*Completely modular, automated, and cross-platform.*
